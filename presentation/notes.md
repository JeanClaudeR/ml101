- how many of you have some programming experience? with python?
- how many of you work with data already?
- what do you know about machine learning so far? what is your impression of it?
- have you used any machine learning before in your work? libraries like scikit-learn?
- how many of you have studied calculus? even just taken one course on it?

we can do this session in a couple ways:

- I want to at least present an overview on the basics behind machine learning. I won't go into detail about the specifics of algorithms but give a high-level intuition that ties the field together (something that is left out a lot of other introductory material!).
- then, if people want and it feels appropriate (and we can get things setup smoothly), we can dive into some examples
- or we can do this in an open question-and-answer format, "all the questions about machine learning you were afraid to ask"
