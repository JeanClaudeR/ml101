Machine learning provides techniques that allow us to "reverse engineer" both natural and artificial phenomena in order to uncover their underlying processes. Doing so not only provides insight into how they work but also the means with which to imitate or reconfigure them.

In this workshop you'll how to think about the world in the "machine learning" way - from an intuitive mathematical perspective - and use popular Python programs to apply this new thinking to just about anything.

We'll look at the basics of machine learning, apply it to some simple problems, then expand outwards to imitate the styles of authors, generate hypothetical geopolitical narratives, and design intelligent learning agents which can be adapted in endless ways.
